The Nitro API uses the following error codes:


Error Code | Meaning

> In case of 400 (Bad Request) response code, there is an error object returned in the response body. The error object contains the error code, error description and, optionally, additional parameters related to the error. E.g:

  "description": "Human readable description of the error",
